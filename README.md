# Predict_Energy_Behavior_of_Prosumers
Overview
The goal of the project is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs.

This project aims to tackle the issue of energy imbalance, a situation where the energy expected to be used doesn't line up with the actual energy used or produced. Prosumers, who both consume and generate energy, contribute a large part of the energy imbalance. Despite being only a small part of all consumers, their unpredictable energy use causes logistical and financial problems for the energy companies.
